## Kayla Sutton's Proposals
*Proposal #1:* Ozone pollution associated with Fort Collins policies

Justification: Fort Collins has among the worst ozone levels in the country. High ozone levels are associated with increased asthma rates and respiratory diseases, which can equate to more ER visits [@chang2006ozone]. Ground level ozone is caused by a reaction between volatile organic compounds (VOCs), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and heat. The main cause of NOx is vehicle emissions [@lowi1990method]. Fort Collins has implemented a number of policies throughout the years aimed at reducing vehicle emissions, mainly by adding protections for alternative transportation (walking, biking, public transport, etc.). 

Research objective: This study will examine the ozone levels following these policies and determine the most successful policy measure.

Proposed methods: To examine ozone pollution levels in relation to policy enactments, we propose a mixed-methods approach combining quantitative data analysis with policy review. Ambient ozone concentration data will be collected from
established air quality monitoring stations over a defined time period, both before and after the implementation of specific policies (e.g., emission regulations, vehicle standards). Time-series analysis will be used to identify trends and changes in ozone levels, controlling for meteorological variables such as temperature and wind patterns. Additionally, satellite remote sensing data will complement ground-based measurements to assess regional variations. A comparative analysis will be conducted across multiple regions with varying policy frameworks to evaluate the effectiveness of different strategies. Policy documents and enforcement reports will be reviewed to understand the scope, stringency, and timeline of enactments. Finally, statistical models, such as difference-in-differences (DiD), will be applied to assess the causal relationship between policy interventions and observed changes in ozone pollution levels.

Expected outcomes: The policy that reduced vehicle emissions the most was the most successful at reducing ozone levels

*Proposal #2:* Correlation between ozone pollution and elevation in Fort Collins

Justification: Fort Collins has among the worst ozone levels in the country. High ozone levels are associated with increased asthma rates and respiratory diseases, which can equate to more ER visits. Ground level ozone is caused by a reaction between volatile organic compounds (VOCs), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and heat [@brodin2010seasonal]. Since heat (temperature) is directly related to elevation [@aneja1992characterization], I want to determine how much of a correlation there is between change in elevation and ground-level ozone levels.

Research objective: To determine the correlation between change in elevation and ground-level ozone pollution.

Proposed methods: To determine the correlation between ozone pollution and changes in elevation, we propose a methodological approach that integrates spatial analysis with statistical modeling. Ozone concentration data will be collected from a network of air quality monitoring stations located at varying elevations, supplemented by satellite remote sensing to ensure broader geographic coverage. Elevation data for each monitoring site will be obtained from digital elevation models (DEMs). A cross-sectional analysis will be conducted to compare ozone levels at different elevations, controlling for confounding factors such as temperature, vegetation cover, and proximity to emission sources.
Correlation coefficients will be calculated to quantify the strength and direction of the relationship between elevation and ozone concentration. Additionally, multivariate linear regression will be used to isolate the effect of elevation on
ozone levels while accounting for other environmental variables. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) will be employed to visualize spatial trends and highlight areas with notable elevation-related variations in ozone pollution

Expected outcomes: Since temperatures are lower at higher elevations, there is a negative correlation between change in elevation and ozone levels.

## Miranda Chin's Proposals
*Proposal #1:* Population trends of invasive aquatic species populations within Colorado

Justification: Aquatic invasive species, such as the Red Shiner and Common Carp, act as a threat to the health and population size of native species [@stone2018aquatic]. As invasive species consume resources and take up niches, it can also result in widespread ecosystem changes as species are outcompeted; invasive species can also affect human processes as well, such as economic or cultural spheres [@rahel2008managing]. Even though invasive species have existed in Colorado for hundreds of years, due to increases in climate change they have become more prevalent than ever. Climate change results in narrowing possible habitats for native species, as can be seen in the temperature increases in rivers and lakes that create uninhabitable areas for wildlife [@rahel2008managing]. However, these issues of resource management are exacerbated by competition with invasive species as these species are often better equipped to survive in these habitats than native species; this may result in extinction or further migration for many species [@stone2018aquatic]. Keeping track of invasive species populations is critical to making managment plans and addressing the changing landscape in Colorado.

Research objective: The objective is to track the population and growth of the Common Carp species in Colorado over the past decade in order to determine the rate at which the species is increasing. 

Proposed methods: I propose using the USGS nonindigenous fish species data online to calculate how common carp populations have changed over time. Depending on how much data is available, my project may have to pivot to focus on different or multiple species rather than solely the common carp. I also plan to use the Colorado Fishing Atlas which is accessible on the Colorado Parks and Wildlife site. This data provides details on where common carp are located and which lakes or rivers they have been spotted in. Through this site, I can find where common carp are spotted and chose a couple areas of study. My study will be more focused on temporal data as it details population change over time. I will use tests such as ANOVA to determine if there are population differences depending on site, as well as simple linear regression to quantify trends. 

Expected outcomes: I expect to find that the common carp has been increasing in population over the years, or expanding the areas in which they inhabit in Colorado. This is important because it can further management plans for addressing invasive species and what actions to take.

*Proposal #2:* Comparison between income and social vulnerability in Colorado counties

Justification: Social vulnerability is a measure of how susceptible a community may be to certain stressors, including environmental hazards, poverty, and health threats [@cutter2003social]. Tracking these patterns and trends are critical to addressing systemic inequalities and finding more efficient ways to address and mitigate them. By determining the relationship between social vulnerability to income, I hope that it will create more clarity on which communities we should be focusing on and aid detection of at-risk communities in efforts to stem hazards. Social vulnerability has been connected to other factors and predictors as well, such as climate change and environmental changes; both of which show a positive correlation as climate change tends to increase alongside vulnerability [@li2023mapping]. However, even with research done on social vulnerability and climate changes, there is still a lack of comprehensive research on how this index connects to other measurements, such as demographic and economic status [@li2023mapping]. With this project, my goal is to clarify the relationship between social vulnerability and income in an effort to create a more holistic picture of who is affected by this index.

Research objective: My research objective is to determine if there is a correlation between average income of counties within Colorado to social vulnerability measures.

Proposed methods: For datasets, I plan to use the Data Commons information tracking individual income in Colorado separated by county. Through this data I will have more information on economic status of counties, and can also normalize the data depending on county population if needed. Additionally, I will also use the Social Vulnerability Index Map and Colorado data in order to find the average index score by county. For statistical tests, I plan on using t-tests to compare the average mean of both social vulnerability and individual income as well as an ANOVA test to determine the correlation between the two variables. 

Expected outcomes: I expect to find that income and social vulnerability are positively correlated with a significant relationship. This is important because it can inform future decisions such as where aid is needed as well as helping to detect where communities may need help.
